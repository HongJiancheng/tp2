## Summary of Contributions

### Key Features implemented & Enhancements 

* Added the ability to assign a person  to a group.(Pull requests #29)

  * What it does: allows the user to assign a person to a specific group. 
  * Justification: This feature allows user to assign person to group instead of just creating group. The purpose of using this address book is to assign different people into different group.Thus the software shall provide a such function.
  * Highlights: Assigning is easy but the hard part is how to synchronize with other part accordingly. 

* Added the ability to rename the group name and automatically update all fields related accordingly.(Pull requests #55)
  * What it does: allows user to rename a specific group name.
  * Highlights: Same as the last feature, the hard part is how to synchronize with other part accordingly. Synchronizing all info of those people under this renamed group is hard part for me.
